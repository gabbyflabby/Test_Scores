# Module 2 Final Project

Gabriela Lopez & Mendel Oster

## Introduction

For this project, we found a dataset and attempted to create a linear regression model for it.

### Source
We took our data from a MIT course assignment linked below
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-071-the-analytics-edge-spring-2017/linear-regression/assignment-2/reading-test-scores/

### Our Data at a glance
Our subset contains information about the demographics and schools for American students taking the exam, derived from 2009 PISA Public-Use Data Files http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2011038                                                  
(PISA) The Programme for International Student Assessment is a test given every three years to 15-year-old students from around the world to evaluate their performance in mathematics, reading, and science. 

#### Features of our data

* minutesPerWeekEnglish: The number of minutes per week the student spend in English class
* studentsInEnglish: The number of students in this student's English class at school
* schoolHasLibrary: Whether this student's school has a library (1/0)
* publicSchool: Whether this student attends a public school (1/0)
* urban: Whether this student's school is in an urban area (1/0)
* schoolSize: The number of students in this student's school
* readingScore: The student's reading score, on a 1000-point scale

### Goal
To predict the reading scores of students from the US on the 2009 PISA exam using Linear Regression models such as OLS (ordinary least squares), Polynomials, Ridge, and Lasso. Additionally, we'll run some statistical tests on the provided data.

## Preprocessing

    See: Data Cleaning.ipynb

### Null values
In the image below you can see the columns with the count of null values and what percentage of that column is null.
<img src="Images/Columns_and_nulls.png" style="width:100px;height:50px" align="center">

As you can see the columns about if the parents have a bachelor degree has more than 10% null values. There is a risk that these parents were simply embarassed and therefore did not provide their information, therefore, if we simply drop these nulls we may be introducing some bias to our datasets. We concluded it was best to drop these two columns.
For the rest of the dataset, we simply dropped the rows with null values.


### Outliers

Since our dataset included some extreme outliers we went with a conventional route of removing them.
We found our Upper fence and Lower fence and removed everything outside of them.
The formula is:
Upper fence = Q3 + (1.5 * IQR)
Lower fence = Q1 â€“ (1.5 * IQR)
Where IQR is the interquartile range


## Exploratory Data Analysis

After cleaning, our data has 3,109 rows, 27 feature columns, and one target column. It's made up of float and integer values.

Of the feature columns, there are 3 quantitative columns, which we are treating as continuous values for our model. All others are categorical with values being either 0 or 1.

We will look at the distribution of these columns and their correlation more when starting to build our model.

## Hypothesis Testing

    See: Hypothesis Testing.ipynb

Next, we made observations and asked questions of our data. We checked various groups for a statistical difference in their reading scores.

*Alternative Hypothesis: There is a statistically significant difference in the reading scores of these groups.*

*Null Hypothesis: There is no statistically significant difference between the reading scores of these groups.*

For all of the following groups we were able to reject the null hypothesis. This means we found the difference between the means of these groups is indeed statistically significant.

### Students with working parents vs non working parents
Average score for students with at least one working parent: 524.81
Average score for students with parents who don't work: 495.77

### Students who speak english at home vs those who do not
Average score for students who speak english at home: 527.25
Average score for students who don't speak english at home: 494.63

### Students with a parent that graduated high school vs those without one
Average score for students with a parent who graduated High school: 526.37
Average score for students with parents who didn't graduate High school: 478.93

### Students who attend public school vs those who don't
Average score for students from Public schools: 520.63
Average score for students from Private schools: 551.61

### Students with a parent from the US vs those without one
Average score for students with a parent born in the US: 526.95
Average score for students with parents born outside of the US: 507.19

### Average reading score for students of different races
We were unable to perform Anova testing for this since some of the races in our dataset are not presented with enough datapoints. However, to visualize the difference between these in our data, we've included the plot below.

### 95% Confidence Interval for Mean of Population Reading Score

We calculated a 95% confidence interval of 350.98 - 696.12.

## Regression Model

    See: Regression Model.ipynb

Plotting our continuous features against our target, we can clearly see no linear relationship exists.
<img src="Images/Scatterplots_continuous_features.png">

Continuous features are: minutesPerWeekEnglish, studentInEnglish, schoolSize
Categorical features are all the rest.

#### OLS
We built two ols models one for our continuous data and one for our categorical data.
For the continuous data we consistently got a very bad score with:
R squared:
RMSE: 
In addition, to our surprise the amount of minutes a student studied English in class did not contribute well to our model. With a P value of: <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< fill in >>>>>>>>>>>>>>
For our caterogical model we got a better score, and took out some features with higher P values
R squared:
RMSE: 

#### Polynomial
We decided to try out a polynomial model for our continuous variables and once again confirmed that these features are not good predictors, with
R squared:
RMSE: 

#### Ridge

R squared:
RMSE:

#### Lasso

R squared:
RMSE: 



## Conclusion & next steps

Being that most of the collected data is binary or categorical it seems that a linear model won't be sufficient to predict student test scores.
